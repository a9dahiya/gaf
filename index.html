    <h2>Apology</h2>

    <p>Dear Mithu</p>
    <p>I am truly sorry for not being a good bf these past 3 weeks</p>

    <p> Ive truly been an asshole to you these 3 weeks, and driven you to this state and make it bad for you and im genuinely sorry for what ive done and i wanna say i love you and id do anything to make you feel happy again i am sorry</p>

    <p>That being said, I deeply regret what happened, and take full responsibility for the consequences of whatever it was that I did. I had an opportunity to try and make things better, and it's clear that the choices I made were wrong, and only made things worse. </p>

    <p>I want you to know that my love for you has always been unwavering.  I love bond we share, and the thought of
      losing that connection is something I cannot bear.</p>

    <p>Above all else, I want you to know that my heart goes out to you, and that I am taking total responsibility for what I have done. </p>

    <p>
    Lastly, let me say that I am sorry. I know I fucked up, and I can't take back what I've done. I'm a human, and sometimes I make mistakes. That's not an excuse, but it is the truth
    </p>

    <p>I understand that words alone may not be enough, but I am willing to do whatever it takes to make amends. Your
      happiness and our connection mean the world to me.</p>

    <p></p>

    <p>With all my love, your IDGAF Akhilesh</p>

    <h3>A Sweet Poem by Akhilesh</h3>
    <h4> I WROTE A POEM FOR YOU
    </h4>
    <p>There was an Aphrodite and a humble peasant, <br>
He came with a gift, trying to be pleasant. <br>
He showed his love, a bond so pure, <br>
And called her his lobster, forever sure. <br>
She returned the love, with eyes so bright, <br>
Together they faced the darkest night. <br>
They almost DGAF, they almost died, <br>
But love held them close, with nothing to hide. <br>
Through trials and storms, their hearts entwined, <br>
In the love of the gods, their souls combined. </p>

    <p>Your Love</p>
    <p>mr DGAF  </p>
